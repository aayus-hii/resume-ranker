# resume-ranker

Overview
This project aims to rank resumes based on job descriptions using machine learning algorithms. It involves preprocessing resume data, extracting features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), building a ranking model, and evaluating its performance.

Files Included
resumedata.csv: Dataset containing resume information.
resume_ranking.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model building, and evaluation.
README.md: Readme file explaining the project and how to use the code.
Other supporting files and folders as necessary.
Dependencies
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
Usage
Setup Environment: Install Python and required libraries if not already installed.

Clone Repository: Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Navigate to Project Directory: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

Install Dependencies: Run the following command to install required dependencies:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

Open Jupyter Notebook: Start Jupyter Notebook by running the command:
jupyter notebook

Open resume_ranking.ipynb: In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the project directory and open the resume_ranking.ipynb file.

Run Code Cells: Execute each code cell in the notebook sequentially to preprocess data, extract features, build the ranking model, and evaluate performance.

Customize and Test: Customize the code as needed for your specific dataset and requirements. Test the model with different job descriptions and resumes for ranking.
